# alternate-hash-map-implementation-Java

This is a light weight HashMap implementation developed for understanding the HashMap in java better.

The KVPair.java class servers as the equivalent of HashMap.

There's a variable named hashTable which is an array of LinkedList.(This linked list is also a light weight version without using generics so as to undestand it better)
